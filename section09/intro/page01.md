- hierarchical structure, non-linear
- defined as a directed acyclic graph
- nodes have 2+ references for children
- many types: binary, ternary, balanced, red-black, heap...
  <br/>
- common operations
  - traversal: preorder, inorder, postorder
  - insertion/deletion: reorganizing
  - search - BFS: Breadth-First Search, level-order traversal, typically using stack and queues - DFS: Depth-first search, branch-based traversal, typically using recursion
    <br/>
- Common techniques & problems
  - top-down vs bottom-up
  - recursive vs iterative
  - common ancestor
  - symmetry
    <br/>
- Complexities: varying depending on tree types
  - compare search in binary tree vs binar search tree

# Binary Search

Searching algorithms:

- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- ...

Binary Search:

- the data should be sorted
- time complexity is O(n)
- types:
  - checking if the target exists
  - checking for the first occurence of the target
  - checking for the last occurence of the target
  - checking the closest element
  - checking the smallest number greater than the target
  - checking the greatest number lesser than the target
  - ...
- what happens if the target doesn't exist?
- what happens if the target occurs more than once?

How it works:

1. Check the middle element
2. Move pointers to consider only the target half
3. Go to step #1 (Recursion or Loop)

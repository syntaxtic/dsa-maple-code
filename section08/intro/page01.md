See images on [Leetcode: Linked Lists](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/linked-list/)

- Similar to Arrays
- Linear data structure
- Nodes linked to each other by reference
- Two types: singly-linked and doubly-linked

- Common operations: traversal, insertion, deletion
- Arrays vs Linked Lists ([read more](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linked-list-vs-array/))

- No access by index. It takes O(n) to visit/read a specific element.
- Insertion/Deletion: Updating the references. No shifting. O(1)

- Common techniques & problems
  - Two-pointers
  - Reversing the list
  - Finding intersections
  - Merging lists
